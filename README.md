Step 1
1. We found a german credit data set: https://online.stat.psu.edu/stat857/node/215/
2. We decided to go with the Cloud Pak for Data as a service (Watson Studio). This will help us connect Watson Assistant to our service later. We also provisioned Watson Knowledge Catalog (because we will be using the personal info of the user), Watson Machine Learning and DB2 instance.
3. We uploaded the data set to Watson Studio.
